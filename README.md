High Altitude Balloon Project.

This is a place to share data, models, firmware, general software, and docs related to the project. We are aiming to get a flight off the ground documenting the process and then develop the technology to reduce cost and get to higher and higher altitudes.

Lets see if this takes off ðŸ˜Š
